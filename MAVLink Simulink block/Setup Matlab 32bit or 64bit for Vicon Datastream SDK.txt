Based on your Matlab version, add path to the correct folder" "MATLAB_vicon_32bit" or "MATLAB_vicon_64bit"


Set up MATLAB 64-bit for the first time to interface with Vicon Datastream SDK:

i.   Install appropriate version of devstudio, e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional.

ii.  Run mbuild –setup (see http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/compiler/f6-22535.html) to configure the right compiler 

Note: professional compiler is typically required for 64 bit, but not 32 bit, as lcc-win32 (MATLAB compiler) is provided. Besides, LCC is not sufficient for mex operation. 

iii. Run Matlab with your script using Client.m, provided in viconDataStreamSDKInstallerWin64.msi

iv.  If necessary, run mex again (e.g. for MAVLINK_Interface.cpp, RealTimeSlower\sfun_time.c)
